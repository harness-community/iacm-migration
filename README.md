# IaCM Migration Utility
This utility helps create workspace(s) in Harness IaCM and migrates Infrastructure State(s) from local machine to Harness IaCM workspace(s). All workspaces are created inside the same account, organization and project.

## Prerequisites
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install following dependancies:
    * openTofu
    * git
    * [hcledit](https://github.com/minamijoyo/hcledit)
    * perl
3. Generate a Harness [API key](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys/)

### Setup
* Create `.env` file with your Harness account ID and api key, using `.env.example` as an example
* Copies of working directories for each workspace to be migrated should be put under the `./workspaces` directory
* Fill out the `input.csv` file with the correct values for each workspace. Refer `input.csv` schema section for more details on the fields
